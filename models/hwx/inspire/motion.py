  Draw directions are a type of shape control.

  the optimized shape must allow the two halves of the mold or the stamping dies

  You can generate shapes that can be molded or stamped by indicating a draw

  Only one type of draw direction can be applied to a design space.

class copy:
	"""
Generic (shallow and deep) copying operations.

Interface summary:

        import copy

        x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
        x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For module specific errors, copy.Error is raised.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for
compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or
class instances).

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the
  extent possible) inserts *the same objects* into it that the
  original contains.

- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,
  inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist
with shallow copy operations:

 a) recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly,
    contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop

 b) because deep copy copies *everything* it may copy too much, e.g.
    administrative data structures that should be shared even between
    copies

Python's deep copy operation avoids these problems by:

 a) keeping a table of objects already copied during the current
    copying pass

 b) letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the
    set of components copied

This version does not copy types like module, class, function, method,
nor stack trace, stack frame, nor file, socket, window, nor array, nor
any similar types.

Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use
to control pickling: they can define methods called __getinitargs__(),
__getstate__() and __setstate__().  See the documentation for module
"pickle" for information on these methods.

class json:
	"""
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) <http://json.org> is a subset of
JavaScript syntax (ECMA-262 3rd edition) used as a lightweight data
interchange format.

:mod:`json` exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library
:mod:`marshal` and :mod:`pickle` modules.  It is derived from a
version of the externally maintained simplejson library.

Encoding basic Python object hierarchies::

    >>> import json
    >>> json.dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}])
    '["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'
    >>> print(json.dumps("\"foo\bar"))
    "\"foo\bar"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\u1234'))
    "\u1234"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\\'))
    "\\"
    >>> print(json.dumps({"c": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0}, sort_keys=True))
    {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO()
    >>> json.dump(['streaming API'], io)
    >>> io.getvalue()
    '["streaming API"]'

Compact encoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> mydict = {'4': 5, '6': 7}
    >>> json.dumps([1,2,3,mydict], separators=(',', ':'))
    '[1,2,3,{"4":5,"6":7}]'

Pretty printing::

    >>> import json
    >>> print(json.dumps({'4': 5, '6': 7}, sort_keys=True, indent=4))
    {
        "4": 5,
        "6": 7
    }

Decoding JSON::

    >>> import json
    >>> obj = ['foo', {'bar': ['baz', None, 1.0, 2]}]
    >>> json.loads('["foo", {"bar":["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]') == obj
    True
    >>> json.loads('"\\"foo\\bar"') == '"foo\x08ar'
    True
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO('["streaming API"]')
    >>> json.load(io)[0] == 'streaming API'
    True

Specializing JSON object decoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> def as_complex(dct):
    ...     if '__complex__' in dct:
    ...         return complex(dct['real'], dct['imag'])
    ...     return dct
    ...
    >>> json.loads('{"__complex__": true, "real": 1, "imag": 2}',
    ...     object_hook=as_complex)
    (1+2j)
    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> json.loads('1.1', parse_float=Decimal) == Decimal('1.1')
    True

Specializing JSON object encoding::

    >>> import json
    >>> def encode_complex(obj):
    ...     if isinstance(obj, complex):
    ...         return [obj.real, obj.imag]
    ...     raise TypeError(f'Object of type {obj.__class__.__name__} '
    ...                     f'is not JSON serializable')
    ...
    >>> json.dumps(2 + 1j, default=encode_complex)
    '[2.0, 1.0]'
    >>> json.JSONEncoder(default=encode_complex).encode(2 + 1j)
    '[2.0, 1.0]'
    >>> ''.join(json.JSONEncoder(default=encode_complex).iterencode(2 + 1j))
    '[2.0, 1.0]'


Using json.tool from the shell to validate and pretty-print::

    $ echo '{"json":"obj"}' | python -m json.tool
    {
        "json": "obj"
    }
    $ echo '{ 1.2:3.4}' | python -m json.tool

class settings:
	"""
Settings are named values maintained across application runs.

   They are user settable via the PreferencesEditor from the File menu.

   Settings are stored hierarchically in sections.
   To set/get a setting you use a slash (/) seperated string.

   This module supports the use cases:
     get the current value of a setting
     set the value of a setting
     define settings for plugins

   To get a setting value use:
     from hwx.common.Setting import getSetting
     getSetting ("Unity/BaseProfile/Workspace/Workspace/Language")

   To set a value use:
     from hwx.common.Setting import setSetting
     setSetting ("Unity/BaseProfile/Workspace/Workspace/Language", "English")

     Only pre-defined settings can be set.
     This is due to the way the settings are defined at application start up
     The startup code only adds settings to the application setting that are
     found in the plugins xml files and are defined via the classes in this file
     This is desinged to clean up old setting definitions from tha application
     definitions

   To define settings for a plugin:
     This is designed to look/work like the c++ plugins settings from an xml
     file
     The defined settings are added to and saved with the application settings
     Each time the settings are defined they replace the previouse ones.
     BUT if the new settings contain a setting found in the old settings
     and the user had changed it, we use the changed setting

     To define plugin settings use the Plugin, TreeItem and Section classes
     See these class docs for forther information of the following example

     #- Example of defining settings for a plugin ----------------------------

def shrinkWrap(parts=None, voxelSize=-1, merge=True, sharpen=False):
	"""
Creates a new part/parts from the selected parts with a single isosurface

  The shrinkwrap is useful when you want to merge optimized results with 
  non-design-space regions. 

  You would do this so you can fit a single PolyNURBS over the entire model.
  By default, the selected parts are merged into a single part. 
  This option can be disabled by setting merge to False.

  Args:
    parts (list[Part]): A list of parts to be shrink wrapped.
    voxelSize (float): Size of each voxel of the shrink wrapped part. Size
      value should be in the range 0 to 1 Defaults to -1 to auto compute the
      voxel dimension of the part.
    merge (bool): Merge the shrink wrapped parts into single or multiple parts.
    sharpen (bool): If set to True, then sharpen the edges of the new shrink
      wrapped part.

  Returns:
    Part: Returns a new shrink wrapped part

class sys:
	"""
This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

Dynamic objects:

argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
  To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
  top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
  to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
  These three are only available in an interactive session after a
  traceback has been printed.

Static objects:

builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
float_info -- a named tuple with information about the float implementation.
float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
hash_info -- a named tuple with information about the hash algorithm.
hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
implementation -- Python implementation information.
int_info -- a named tuple with information about the int implementation.
maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
platform -- platform identifier
prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
thread_info -- a named tuple with information about the thread implementation.
version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
version_info -- version information as a named tuple
dllhandle -- [Windows only] integer handle of the Python DLL
winver -- [Windows only] version number of the Python DLL
_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding -- [Windows only]
__stdin__ -- the original stdin; don't touch!
__stdout__ -- the original stdout; don't touch!
__stderr__ -- the original stderr; don't touch!
__displayhook__ -- the original displayhook; don't touch!
__excepthook__ -- the original excepthook; don't touch!

Functions:

displayhook() -- print an object to the screen, and save it in builtins._
excepthook() -- print an exception and its traceback to sys.stderr
exc_info() -- return thread-safe information about the current exception
exit() -- exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit
getdlopenflags() -- returns flags to be used for dlopen() calls
getprofile() -- get the global profiling function
getrefcount() -- return the reference count for an object (plus one :-)
getrecursionlimit() -- return the max recursion depth for the interpreter
getsizeof() -- return the size of an object in bytes
gettrace() -- get the global debug tracing function
setcheckinterval() -- control how often the interpreter checks for events
setdlopenflags() -- set the flags to be used for dlopen() calls
setprofile() -- set the global profiling function
setrecursionlimit() -- set the max recursion depth for the interpreter
settrace() -- set the global debug tracing function

class time:
	"""
This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.

There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.
